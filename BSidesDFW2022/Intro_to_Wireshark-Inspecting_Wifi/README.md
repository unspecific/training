# Exploring Wireless Networks with Wireshark

This introduction to Wireshare, the powerful protocol analyzer, will explain the the basics of the UI then work on a real time example of monitoring a WiFi network, including decrypting the packets.  This class will also utilize a few command line tools, such as airomon and airodump.  If you do not have a WiFi card that can be used in monitor mode, you will still be able to follow along via a packet capture provided.  
* Live USBs will be provided.
* Laptop needed for hands on.
